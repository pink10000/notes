# Introduction 
**Stochastic Differential Equations** or SDEs are 
- continuous-time 
- continuous state space 
[[Markov Chains#Definition (Markov Process)|Markov processes]], where $X(t) \in \R$ for $t \in \R$.

A key example is Brownian motion. The goals are to 
- simulate $X(t)$
- sample from distribution of $X(t)$
- find distribution of $X(t)$
- compute [[Moments]], e.g. $\E{X(t)}$ or $\E{X(t)^{2}}$
