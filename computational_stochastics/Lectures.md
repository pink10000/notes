# Lecture 1 (1/5)
- Key questions: distributions, sampling, features of a system
- [[Random Sampling]]
- [[Ising Model]]
- The main idea is that sampling [[Random Sampling#Example 1 (Monte Carlo Estimation of Pi)|allows integration]], [[Random Sampling#Example 2 (Multidimensional Hypercube Integral)|scales better than grids]], and solves [[Ising Model#Problem|impossible sums]].
