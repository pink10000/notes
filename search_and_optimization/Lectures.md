# Lecture 2 (1/7)
> Okay, just to continue on the ramblings I had in the beginning of Monday a little bit, here is a brief history of the world. So in the beginning, there was stuff. Okay. And then people appeared. I realized that they can do things with stuff, and they want stuff, and you know, have their sort of trajectories across the stuff. 
> And of course, right after people realized that they want stuff, slavery started. Right so, certain people realized that they can control other people physically and get more stuff. 
> Of course, the good thing is that soon after that, people started to realize there is another level of ... kind of meta-stuff, which is technology.
> Which started with the wheel, probably I don't know, or fire. Then printing, and then the internet, you know. All of these like we said in the first lecture are functions that allow you to operate on this stuff. They are way more powerful than people... mostly. Of course a lot more people moved up and become engineers, and there you know other people who want to slave people at this level and then. But now with computers and information and AI, we do realize there's luckily another level as well. This is was what I was referring to as the science of hell.
