# Definition (Complex Integration)

We want to intuit on how we integrate complex functions.

Let $f: [a,b] \to \C$ be a bounded [complex](../ch1-real-complex-numbers/Complex%20Numbers.md) function. Since $f$ is complex, then $f(x) = u(x) + i \cdot v(x)$ where $u,v$ are real functions. Then we say that $f$ is [Riemann Integrable](Riemann-Stieltjes%20Integral.md)
