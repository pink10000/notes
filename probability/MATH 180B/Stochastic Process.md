# Definition (Stochastic Process)
A **Stochastic Process** is a family of random variables $X_{t} \in \Omega$ indexed by $t$ where $S \subseteq \R^{d}$ is the state space. 

Typically, $t \in [0, \infty)$ or $t \in [a, b]$ or $t \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots \}$ etc. 

# Definition (Discrete Time Stochastic Process)
A **discrete time stochastic process** is a sequence of random variables $X_{n} \in S$ for $n = 0, 1,2, 3, \dots$ (or excluding $0$). If $S$ is finite or countably infinite, then the stochastic process is a **discrete state** process. 

# Definition (Joint Distribution of Stochastic Processes)
The [[Joint Distribution]] of a stochastic process is 
$$
\P(X_{0} = i_{0}, X_{1}= i_{1}, \dots, X_{n} = i_{n})
$$
where $i_{j} \in S$ for $1 \leq j \leq n$.
