This is the face version of the [[Handshake Lemma]].
# Face Handshake Lemma 
Each face $F$ has a boundary that is some loop $L$. We can define 
$$
\text{Sides}(F) = |E(L)|
$$
by following the edges on the loop for some face. So, if we could every face, 
$$
\sum_{F} \text{Sides}(F) = 2|E|
$$
which is the Face Handshake Lemma.
