# Kruskal's Algorithm
Let $T$ be the [[Graph#Definition (Subgraph)|subgraph]] of $G$ with no edges, but the same vertices. While does not connect $G$, add the [[Weighted Graph|lightest]] edge $e$ that does not form a [[Cycle|cycle]] with $T$. Then $T$ is the [[Minimum Spanning Tree|minimum spanning tree (MST)]].
