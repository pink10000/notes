# Definition
The **degree** of a vertex $v$ denoted as $\deg(v)$ is the number of edges that $v$ is [[Graph#Definition Incident Vertex|incident]] on. 
```mermaid
graph LR;
	A((A)) o--o B((B));
	A((A)) o--o C((C));
```
Here, $\deg(A) = 2$ and $\deg(B) = \deg(C) = 1$. 

# Definition: $d-$regular
A graph $G$ is **$d-$regular** if all vertices have degree $d$. We can also say that that $G$ is just **regular**. 

For example:
```mermaid
flowchart
	A((A))
	B((B))
	C((C))
```
is $0-$regular, 
```mermaid
graph LR; 
	A((A)) x--x B((B));
	B((B)) x--x C((C));
	C((C)) x--x D((D));
	D((D)) x--x A((A));
```
is $2-$regular, 
```mermaid
graph 
	A((A)) x--x B((B));
	C((C)) x--x D((D));
	E((E)) x--x F((F));	
```

is $1-$regular. 

## Limitations
Some graphs you cannot draw. For example, there is no $3-$regular graph with $5$ vertices.
