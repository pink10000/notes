# Definition (Kempe Chain)
Suppose we wanted to pick $2$ colors (eg. red, blue). Consider the subgraph consisting of only red and blue vertices, $G_{rb}$. Now, pick a connected component of $G_{rb}$, and switch the colors of all the vertices in this component. 

This operation preserves valid colorings.
