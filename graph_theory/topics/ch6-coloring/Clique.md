# Definition (Clique)
The **clique number**, $\omega(G)$ of a [[Graph]] $G$ is the largest $n$ so that [[Complete Graph]] $K_{n}$ is a subgraph of $G$. 
## Corollary (Chromatic Number Lower Bound)
For any graph $G$, [[Coloring#Definition (Chromatic Number)|chromatic number]] $\chi(G) \geq \omega(G)$ by [[Coloring#Lemma (Complete Chromatic Number)]]. 

This bound is unfortunately far from tight.
