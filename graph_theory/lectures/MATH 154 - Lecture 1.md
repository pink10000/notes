Because Obsidian is on Mermaid version 11.4 ([1]([https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/6289](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/6289 "https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/6289"))), we get the bug ([2]([https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/6289](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/6289 "https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/6289"))), and so we can fix this by using `dataviewjs` as seen [here](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/use-updated-version-of-mermaid-js-with-dataviewjs/58748).

Actually, I think using `x--x` will be easier.

Thank you to Ethan for providing me these notes while I helped him buy a Swift album.
