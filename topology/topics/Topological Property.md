# Definition (Topological  Property)
A property of a space is **topological** if the property holds for $X$ implies the property holds for any $Y$ where $Y \cong X$.

For example, being [[Hausdorff Property|Hausdorff]] is topological. Being bounded for a [[Metric Space]] is not topological. From [[Topological Homeomorphisms#Example 1|example 1]], $(-1, 1) \cong \R$, but $\R$ is not bounded.
