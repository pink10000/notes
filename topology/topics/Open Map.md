# Definition (Open Map)
The function 
$$
f : (X, \tau_{X}) \to (Y, \tau_{Y})
$$
is an **open map** if $\forall$ open $U$ in $X$, $f(X)$ is open in $Y$. Clearly, for bijective $f$, 
$$
f^{-1} \text{ is continuous} \iff f \text{ is an open map}
$$

From the previous example, clearly $[0, 1/2)$ is an open set in the domain $[0, 1)$. However, it's image is not open in $S$.
