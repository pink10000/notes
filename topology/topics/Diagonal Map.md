# Definition
A **diagonal map** is a map from 
$$
\Delta : X \to X \times X 
\quad\quad\quad
x \to (x, x)
$$
which is also [[Continuity|continuous]]. 

# Two Spaces
In general, for any [[Metric Space|metric spaces]] $X_{1}, X_{2}, Y_{1}, Y_{2}$, 
$$
f_{1}: X_{1} \to Y_{1} 
\quad\quad\quad
f_{2}: X_{2} \to Y_{2}
$$
are continuous, then 
$$
f_{1} \times f_{2} \to X_{1} \times X_{2} \to Y_{1}\times Y_{2}
$$
are continuous. 

## Generalization
In general, 
$$
f_{1} \times \cdots \times f_{n} : 
X_{1} \times \cdots \times X_{n} \to 
Y_{1} \times \cdots \times Y_{n}
$$
is continuous.
